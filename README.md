This repository simply stores some RenWeb report card templates I designed in 2014.

This is exciting for me, because it was my introduction to HTML and other code languages. Apparently this thing uses javascript to loop stuff, but I couldn't tell you one way or the other. I just had fun designing something readable and pleasantly displayed.

There are two versions of each template, one being a "final" edition that looped a graduation/progression message at the end.

If you are an admin of a school that uses RenWeb, and you somehow stumbled on this repo, you have my full permission to do whatever you want with it. Enjoy!
